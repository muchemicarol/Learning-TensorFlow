## Quickstart Introduction To TensorFlow
- Start with using Sequential API (User-Friendly)
- Create models by plugging together the blocks.

The code in the Notebook appear in this order:
- Load MNIST dataset
- Build a Neural Network (NN) that calssifies images
- Train the NN.
- Evaluate accuracy of the model
